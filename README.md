# linuxMac
A script to setup a bootable linux partition on Macbooks.

## Installing and Running
Installing the script is as easy as possible, just click on the latest release on the right side of your screen and click on the first file to download it.

Once the file is downloaded, double click on it. This will install Linux onto your mac.
If this doesn't work, open a terminal window and run "cd Downloads" followed by "chmod +x linuxmac.zsh"

If the program asks for your password, enter your user password (the one you use to enter your computer).

It's recommended to not download the zsh file direct from the repo as it will likely be an unstable development version.

## What does this script do?
This script installs linux onto your mac, with a single click (and some typing in your password). It is not a virus (please trust us here).

## Supported Linux distros
### Intel
Currently none. Likely won't be added for a while.
### Apple Silicon
Please note that the script currently does not work on M4 CPUs.

- Fedora
- Alpine Linux

More distros to be fully implemented in the future.
