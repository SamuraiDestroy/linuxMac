# linuxMac
A script to setup a bootable linux partition on Macbooks.

## Installing and Running
Installing the script is as easy as possible, just click on the latest release on the right side of your screen and click on the first file to download it.

Once the file is downloaded, first double click on it to unzip, enter the new directory, and double click on the file inside. This will install fedora onto your mac.

In case you want to install something other than fedora, you may enter the terminal and enter your preferred OS. Currently, the only supported OS is fedora, so you need not worry.

If the program asks for your password, enter your user password (the one you use to enter your computer).

## What does this script do?
This script installs linux onto your mac, with a single click (and some typing in your password). It is not a virus (please trust me here).

## Supported Linux distros
### Intel
Currently none.
### Apple Silicon
Please note that the script currently does not work on M4 CPUs.

Fedora is the only implemented distro as of the 10th of January, 2025.


## TODO list
- Replace Asahi Fedora Builder with Fedora Asahi Remix (Fedora Builder is buggier apparently)
- Add CPU detection
- Add more distros
- Linux partition size customisation
- Comments (The people must learn.)
- Auto install useful packages?
