# linuxMac
A script to setup a bootable linux partition on Macbooks.

## Installing and Running
Installing the script is as easy as possible, just click on the latest release on the right side of your screen and click on the first file to download it.

Once the file is downloaded, double click on it. This will install Fedora onto your mac.

In case you want to install something other than fedora, you may enter the terminal and enter your preferred OS. Currently, the only implemented OS is Fedora, so you need not worry.

If the program asks for your password, enter your user password (the one you use to enter your computer).

It's recommended to not download the zsh file direct from the repo as it may be an unstable development version.

## What does this script do?
This script installs linux onto your mac, with a single click (and some typing in your password). It is not a virus (please trust us here).

## Supported Linux distros
### Intel
Currently none.
### Apple Silicon
Please note that the script currently does not work on M4 CPUs.

Fedora is the only implemented distro as of the 10th of January, 2025.


## TODO list
- Add more distros
- Linux partition size customisation (This would probably only be for the Intel distros since Asahi already lets you customise it.)
- Comments (The people must learn.)
- Auto install useful packages?
- Issue template (I fear it will be more than necessary)
